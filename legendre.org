Lately I've been trying to learn some fundamental physics and related math (representation theory of Lie groups and that sort of stuff). Turns out it's got quite a few prerequisites apart from knowledge of abstract group axioms! 
One of them which is sort of blocking is my lack of intuitive understanding of the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian. 

Suppose we've got a space $Q$ that would be the /configuration/ space. Typically (TODO I think? at least in physics) it's a manifold, that is, something looking like a Eucledian space locally (TODO more agda?).
Configuration space is the 'snaphot' space at every point in time. It's not necessary 'positions' space, e.g. for a quantum system it would be the space of wavefunctions.
TODO FIXME what does it have to do with manifold????

# TODO can I inline macros?
Some simple examples. 

1. (one of the most trivial) particle on a straight line in 1D space. (NOTE: well, 1D space doesn't have anything BUT straight lines, reference to extrinsic and intrinsic curvature). Then $Q = \mathbb R$.
2. 


 # TODO actually not a great example? 

 $Q = \mathbb R$. This is 


Trivial example is probably straight line 


# TODO actually, this is defined via something called generalized coordinates, but I haven't got much time to understand it https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_coordinates
# TODO maybe that's a post about agda as well???
# would be soo coool..
