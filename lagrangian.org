Ok, cool. Not that we have space to define things on, let's do that. Another basic assumption from classical mechanics is that all systems are goverened by something called Lagragian.

So, if you are like me and ever been remotely interested in classical mechanics, you know the drill. 

Problem statement: the system goes from state $q_0$ to $q_1$ within time interval $[t_0, t_1]$. We want to figure out how, i.e. which path, i.e. a function $\gamma: t \in [t_0, t_1] \to Q$  does it take? 
TODO actually tangent bundle??
TODO lagrangian

To do taht, we define a functional called 'action' $S(\gamma) = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} L(\gamma(t), \gamma'(t)) dt$ and claim that the system chooses a path, such that $S$ is stationary to first order. $L$ is something called 'Lagrangian', which depends on TODO tangent bundle

TODO typically minimum? What are the interesting examples with maximum??
TODO https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_action

So far so good. If you see it for the first time it sort of blows your mind so you are curious what's next. After that, 99% of explanations are considering a classical particle in a potential well: $L(q, v) = \frac{1}{2} m v \cdot v - V(q)$. Then they plug in the Euler-Lagrange equation and get Newthon's law of motion. Yeah, awesome. The problem with those explanations is they stop there. So what? What's up with that weird thing which has units of energy but not quite? What's a Lagrangian? I was pretty comfy solving potential wells without having to minimize a functional, thank you very much.

Next, you try to look up some sort of definition for Lagrangian. That turns out to be really not easy! 
The closest insights you get on this page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics is
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Lagrangian is a function of the generalized coordinates, their time derivatives, and time, and contains the information about the dynamics of the system
#+END_QUOTE
 and
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
the position coordinates and velocity components are all independent variables
#+END_QUOTE
I'm lucky enough to know Russian, but Russian wikipedia page is not any more helpful. You probably have a gut feeling that it's gotta at least be a smooth function or someithing like that, but it's not really mentioned anywhere. Okay, for now you decide that it must be any reasonble function of $q$, $v$ and $t$. Actually, forget time dependency for now, it's tricky enough as it is.

So now that you established what's the object you are trying to study, you go through more examples. Next one is typically double pendulum or 'sliding pendulum' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics#Pendulum_on_a_movable_support. But yet again, Lagrangian is postulated to be the difference of kinetic and potential energy, which is not very convincing.

Next example if typically electromagnetism: $L = \frac{1}{2} v \cdot v -e \phi + e v \cdot A$. Whoa guys, I'm still not done with simple systems! EM fields are scary, things spiral around and radiate, come on.

# TODO even Baez
# TODO momentum equals mass times velocity

TODO something about dogmatism
Of course, for practical purposes you **just** (TODO italic) guess the Lagrangian that gives you desired physical properties. 
However, what if we reverse the process? As in, given a Lagrangian can we come up with a universe where it would describe the physics??

TODO hamiltonian

TODO hamiltonian later; first try blindly and formally and see that it fails; then try explaining why (regularity and where the legendre transformation defined)




Ok fine, you think. I'll come up with my own Lagrangians. 

1. Obvious example of **a** function is $L(q, v) = 0$. Nice, let's see what does that mean.
 
    Well, if you think about it, action is always zero, so any path would be stationary. This should probably ring an alarm but let's see what happens if we try to plug that in Hamilton's approach...

    TODO hamilton's equations: $dq/dt = 0$, $dp/dt = 0$. So $q = const$ and $p = const$. Well, that doesn't look good. First of all, the position can't change. Doesn't that mean that $p$ must be zero then? But Hamilton's equations don't really imply that. Ugh, well, maybe we have to go throught Legendre transform and all that stuff to figure out what's wrong with zero lagrangian?
    # TODO differentiable??

2. Okay, another attempt. $L(q, v) = v \cdot v$ is boring$, it's like typical example, but with zero potential energy. Hmm... what if we make it equal to potential energy **only**? $L(q, v) = - q \cdot q$.
TODO what if we try to minimize the functional directly

TODO assume 1D for now

$ d/dt pL/pv = pL/pq $

TODO mention boundary value problem??
so $0 = -2q$. Err, that's looks bad. Does it only work if $q = 0$? Which seems like a sensible solution, except for our Lagrangian actually taking its **maximum** value when $q = 0$. Taking literally any other path than staying at $0$ would decrease the action. Which is consistent with Hamilton's principle, since it needn't be a local minima, but a stationary point. It's interesting however that for 'physical' trajectories action does seem to take minimum value (hence the traditional 'minimum action principle'). So what happened here?

After a bit of TODO 
$d/dt (2v) = - 2q$; $q'' = -q$. Right, we've all seen this. The interesting thing though is most authors often skip right to the $q(t) = A sin(\omega t)$ solution, which is what we normally think of when we imagine a swinging oscillator. However, the equilibrium solution $q = 0$ is still here if our $q_0 = q_1 = 0$ (TODO rename them as start and finish or something?)! 


TODO ugh. tried evaluating lagrangian explicitly around q = 0, and it looks like it's a minimum as well :(


TODO actualy q === 0 is an UNSTABLE equilibrium! Since if we deflect it, we will never return back (due to energy conservation or whatever). in that sense, it kind of makes sense that lagrangian takes maximum value?

It's pretty interesting though that for non-zero kinetic energy lagrangian is taking it's minimum value at the solution though. What's the reason for the switch here? 


Ok, fine. Euler-Lagrange equations tells us that the BVP is not even defined for any values other than $q = 0$. It still feels a bit unsatisfactory; what's wrong with removing the kinetic energy term?

To investigate that and try to get some intuition, let's go back to the following 'standard' Lagrangian $L_m(q, v) = \frac{1}{2} m v \cdot v - \frac{1}{2} q \cdot q$. It's just a pendulum/harmonic oscillator basically. The Lagrangian of our interest is just like that but with mass equal to zero!
So the E-L equations boil down to $L_m$ is just $m q'' = -q$. We are ruling out $q \== 0$ now, so this is a periodic motion with frequency $\omega = \frac{1}{m}$.

What happens to a particle on a spring if we reduce its mass while keeping the stiffness fixed? The frequency goes up.

TODO need to consider leftmost and rightmost position?? TODO why would it minimize lagrangian??

So, the smaller the mass, the more frequently it's going to oscillate, basically spending as much time as possible close to its leftmost and rightmost positions. We can't take the limit $m \to 0$ though, since $\sin \frac{1}{x}$ is discontinuous at $0$. So I guess that's how 
# TODO err. I guess it bullshit, this 'amount of time' should be independent of period...
# TODO I suppose here we'd have to change the coordinates to absolute, so it's easier to think about what happens within a period?... or within the same period of time, to be correct

TODO why can't a particle jump up high?

TODO from the physical point of view why does it want to oscillate more often??
# TODO shoould we keep amplitude same too????
TODO maybe that's a demonstration Lagrangian approach doesn't make sense on large time scales, only locally? cause it's not clear which solution to choose

# TODO ok, let's consider one swing? Gonna be tricky though since it is mass dependent...

# TODO maybe better to consider particle in kinda gravitational field here instead... but not involving the mass?? L(v, x) = mv^2/2 - gx? easier since it doesn't involve periodic motion.


TODO consider if we start and ed in the rightmost position within a period timespan. Why this path is not stationary? TODO basically, because we could shift everything in the middle in both directions and decrease/increase the lagrangian?


Right. So we found out that not having terms dependent on $v$ (which is kind of like limiting mass to $0$) can get us in trouble. Still unclear what's wrong with such a Lagrangian mathematically, as a function though!
TODO do a better analysis of second variation?




p = dL/dv = 0 ??? H = q \cdot q$.
so, dq/dt =  dH/dp = 0, so q = const?
    dp/dt = -dH/dq = 2q what does that even mean given that 
Basically, the only solution compatible with that is $q = 0$, $p = 0$. If you think about in terms of ordinary energy, it kind of makes sense, the particle has no kinetic energy at all, so no matter what, it can't get past the potential barrier. However, if you imagine same particle starting at $q \ne 0$, if you think in terms of minimizing the path, it wants to spend as much time as it can at 'q = 0', it doesn't matter to the particle how fast does it have to get from initial $q$ to $q = 0$. so we can a discontinuity in the path, that explains our problems with Hamilton's equations? 

TODO fuck, actually, as little time at q = 0! Cause the less is position, the bigger is action!
TODO max position??
TODO sin, etc

1. Let's try having some dependency on $v$. $L(q, v) = A \cdot v$, where $A$ is some scalar field.

$p = pL/pv = A$. So, $H = v \cdot p - L = v \cdot A - A \cdot v = 0$. Crap, we've seen zero Hamiltonian already and it didn't end up well. What's wrong here??? More generally, suppose $L(q, v) = C(q) \cdot v + D(q)$. Then, $pL/pv = C(q)$, and we're gonna get $H(q, p) = -D(q)$. So, if Lagrangian only got linear velocity terms, it has no impact on system dynamics??

Again, in essence that is similar to considering a particle with mass $m$ in EM field and limiting mass to $0$. TODO is it? what about phi??

TODO physical intuition about lagrangian
NOTE lagrangian has units of energy

Some typical examples of Lagrangians:

1. TODO zero lagrangian? Probably doesn't make physical sense... 
2. Free particle: $L(q, v) = v \cdot v$. Basically, it's like if only got kinetic energy here (I dropped the $\frac{1}{2} m$ term)
3. Particle in a potential field: $L(q, v) = v \cdot v - V(q)$, where $V$ is some smooth function of position, which physicists typically label as 'Potential energy'
4. Since Lagrangian is technically just a function os position and velocity, why not $L(q, v) = q \cdot v$ (TODO does it even make sense?) TODO what the hell is this thing??
 
So far so good. However, I wanted to get a bit more intuition about the shape of Lagrangians and how it corresponded to actual physics/behaviour. To figure that out, one could try and directly minimise the action over the path they interested in, however it's hardly intuitive!
What turns out to be easier is if we use the Hamiltonian approach.

 TODO blah blah link to Hamiltonian wiki page
 
$p_j = \pdv{L}{v^j}$
$H(q, p) = \sum_i v^i p_i - L(q, v)$
 
TODO for 4: shit, we get zero hamiltonian. so what does that mean????
hmm, it doesn't depend on qv terms?? and it's all linear..
o, then
dq/dt = pH/pp = 0
dp/dt = -pH/pq = 0

so? q = const; p = const??
that's a pretty weird system... but in this case, conjugate momentum is equal to position!
TODO err. that's all very bizarre

TODO: looks like it's an example of irregular hamiltonian. give it as an example to solve formally; but also explain why is it bad
see Baez with example of GR free particle hamiltonian


fucking hell. why is that so complicated? :(
how to translate back from momentum to velocity??


ok, as Baez says in classical mechanics book, that basically means no temporal evolution is possible.
TODO still unclear what's up with inconsistent initial conditions here...
